            <h2><b>Who is Nompumelelo</b></h2>
            <p> Born on the 2nd of February 2004, in a small town called Kuruman situated in Northen Cape, Nompumelelo is a vibrant student and content creator with a sharp eye for color, texture, and trends, blending her love for makeup, fashion, and style into a personal brand that thrives on social media.</p>
